    <h2>A Thousand Years</h2>
    <h4>(Song by Christina Perri)</h4>

    <p>The day we met
      <br>  Frozen I held my breath
      <br> Right from the start
      <br> I knew that I'd found a home for my heart</p>
      <br> Beats fast
      <br> colors and promises
      <br> How to be brave?
      <br> How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
      <br> But watching you stand alone
      <br> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow</p>
      <br> One step closer</p>
      <br> I have died everyday waiting for you
      <br> Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
      <br> I'll love you for a thousand more</p>
      <br> Time stands still
      <br> Beauty in all she is
      <br> I will be brave
      <br> I will not let anything take away
      <br> What's standing in front of me
      <br> Every breath, every hour has come to this</p>
      <br> One step closer</p>
      <br> I have died everyday waiting for you
      <br> Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
      <br> I'll love you for a thousand more</p> 
      <br> And all along I believed I would find you
      <br> Time has brought your heart to me
      <br> I have loved you for a thousand years
      <br> I'll love you for a thousand more</p>
      <br> Ooh-ooh
      <br> Ooh-ooh
      <br> I love you for a thousand more
      <br> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
      <br> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</P>
      <br> One step closer</p>
      <br> I have died everyday waiting for you
      <br> Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
      <br> I'll love you for a thousand more</p>
      <br> And all along I believed I would find you
      <br> Time has brought your heart to me
      <br> I have loved you for a thousand years
      <br> I'll love you for a thousand more</p>
